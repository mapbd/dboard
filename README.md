# Coronavirus-Dashboard
Building a Tableau dashboard based on New York Times COVID-19 cases data by U.S. county and COVID Tracking Project testing by state. The dashboard is hosted on my Tableau Public page and can be accessed through the link below.

The dashboard is built using a merged dataset from the two principal data sources (as well as complimentary population and regional metrics). The R code for this project can be found on this site as "covid_script."
